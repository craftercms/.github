CrafterCMS is an open source, [composable](https://craftercms.com/blog/2021/07/what-is-a-composable-dxp) and [headless](https://craftercms.com/blog/2024/01/headless-cms-everything-you-need-to-know) content management platform that provides freedom for your technology choices, supporting all types of content-centric, dynamic sites and apps. CrafterCMS users run global websites, e-commerce experiences, corporate intranets, consumer mobile apps, customer portals and more on the platform. CrafterCMS can run as a headless content server alongside your web or mobile application, and can host templated web applications. In contrast to most CMSs that store content in a database, CrafterCMS utilizes Git as its content repository, providing several advantages over traditional CMS architectures.

Architecturally, CrafterCMS decouples the content authoring system from the content delivery system, providing very high levels of security, performance, and scalability. The content authoring platform is an API-first headless system built on Git and provides comprehensive enterprise-class content management services, along with a React-based app (Crafter Studio) that provides a user-friendly experience for content authors, editors, reviewers and publishers. The content delivery platform (Crafter Engine) is also an API-first headless system that is stateless and serverless (no database dependencies), delivers content exceptionally fast, and scales elastically very well. 

Both the authoring and delivery systems of CrafterCMS are built in [Java/Spring](https://craftercms.com/blog/2023/11/java-cms-everything-you-need-to-know), and incorporate OpenSearch for native search capabilities. Crafter Engine, the content delivery system, offers total flexibility on both the client side and server side. If you're building your application pure headless, you can simply call CrafterCMS for content and search capabilities via the REST or GraphQL APIs. For server-side development, Groovy and Javascript (for Node.js, Next.js, Nuxt.js, etc.) are natively supported for extending our APIs, creating custom APIs, and server-side rendering. For templated sites/apps, FreeMarker is included. CrafterCMS ships an SDK on NPM that helps you wire in-context editing features ([Experience Builder](https://craftercms.com/docs/current/by-role/developer/common/experience-builder.html)) so you can wire that to your favorite front-end technology like [React](https://craftercms.com/blog/technical/cms-for-spas-building-react-apps-with-craftercms-4), [Vue](https://craftercms.com/blog/technical/cms-for-spas-building-vue-nuxt-apps-with-craftercms-4), [Angular](https://craftercms.com/blog/technical/cms-for-spas-building-angular-apps-with-craftercms-4) or anything else, providing content authors with a [visual editing experience](https://youtu.be/UEXQ_uqjJ1U) for all your sites/apps.
