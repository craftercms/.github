CrafterCMS is an open source, [composable](https://craftercms.com/blog/2021/07/what-is-a-composable-dxp) and [headless](https://craftercms.com/blog/2021/03/what-is-headless--the-next-phase-of-headless-cms-technology) content management platform that provides freedom for your technology choices, supporting all types of content-centric, dynamic sites and apps. CrafterCMS can run as a headless content server alongside your web or mobile application, and can host templated web applications. In contrast to most CMSs that store content in a database, CrafterCMS utilizes Git as its content repository, providing several advantages over traditional CMS architectures.

CrafterCMS itself is built in Java/Spring, and offers total flexibility on both the client side and server side. If you're building your application pure headless, you can simply call CrafterCMS for content and search capabilities via the REST or GraphQL APIs. For server-side development, Groovy and Javascript (for Node.js, Next.js, Nuxt.js, etc.) are natively supported for extending our APIs, creating custom APIs, and server-side rendering. For templated sites/apps, FreeMarker is included. CrafterCMS ships an SDK on NPM that helps you wire in-context editing features ([Experience Builder](https://docs.craftercms.org/en/4.0/developers/experience-builder.html)) so you can wire that to your favorite front-end technology like [React](https://craftercms.org/blog/2022/05/cms-for-spas-building-react-apps-with-craftercms-4), [Vue](https://craftercms.org/blog/2022/07/cms-for-spas-building-vue-nuxt-apps-with-craftercms-4), [Angular](https://craftercms.org/blog/2022/07/cms-for-spas-building-angular-apps-with-craftercms-4) or anything else, providing content authors with a [visual editing experience](https://youtu.be/UEXQ_uqjJ1U) for all your sites/apps.
